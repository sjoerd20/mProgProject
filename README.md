## Problem Statement
The music at parties is usually done by one person on a single device, because it is impossible to connect multiple 		   device to a single speaker. This means thate a single person has to choose all songs or pass his/her telephone round the group. 
This is something that happens a lot at parties of people from a young age (around 16) to people in their late twenties/early thirties.
	
## Solution
The solution is to make an app that contains a playlist shared with multiple people whereby one device is the master device that plays the music from the playlist via a music API.
	
## Prerequisites
### data sources
	1. Music from device
	2. If possible, music from music app or online
	
### external components
	- [Android mediaplayer](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/media/mediaplayer#java)
	
### review of similar apps

### identify hardest parts to implement
	Hardest part to implement is to gather music from a real music app, instead of using music from the local storage of a single device
