## Problem Statement
The music at parties is usually done by one person on a single device, because it is impossible to connect multiple 		   device to a single speaker. This means thate a single person has to choose all songs or pass his/her telephone round the group. 
This is something that happens a lot at parties of people from a young age (around 16) to people in their late twenties/early thirties.
	
## Solution
The solution is to make an app that contains a playlist shared with multiple people whereby one device is the master device that plays the music from the playlist via a music API.
